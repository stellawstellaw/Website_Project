## My Portfolio Website - PRD

**Problem/Goal:**
I want to make a portfolio website thing so I can have a lot of random stuff from one website

**Site Theme:**
Can you make it look colorful but clean

**Pages I Will Create:**
- [ ] index.html (Home) - the main page when you first go on the website
- [ ] about.html (About Me) - Put a heading on the top that says "About me" and on the bottom write in smaller text "hi"
- [ ] Page 3:  Projects- It will have a lot of buttons to my different projects (I don't have any yet)

**Features (checkboxes for what I will build):**
- [ ] Shared header with site title/logo on EVERY page
- [ ] Navigation menu linking all pages
- [ ] Active page highlighting (current page looks different)
- [ ] Unique `<title>` for each page
- [ ] Shared footer on EVERY page
- [ ] At least 2 sections per page using `<section>`
- [ ] Proper file structure (all files in one folder)
- [ ] External CSS file (style.css)

**Success Check (how I know I'm done):**
- [ ] All pages link correctly (no broken links)
- [ ] Header is identical on every page
- [ ] Footer is identical on every page
- [ ] Navigation highlights current page
- [ ] Browser tab shows unique title per page
- [ ] I can explain the DOM Tree of my pages
- [ ] I can explain every HTML element I used

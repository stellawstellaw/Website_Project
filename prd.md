1. Goal:
I want to create a sticker sheet where when i click on a canvas an emoji will appear where i clicked
2. Features
I want there to be a small realistic animation on the sticker when it is placed. I want there to be 2 different sticker sets, with buttons to choose different ones. The first one will have animals and the second one will have food. I want there to also be a reset button in the corner that erases all the stickers on the canvas. 
3. Success Checks
The correct sticker set sticker should spawn in when clicked on canvas. The reset button should remove all the stickers on the canvas. There should be a small animation when the sticker is placed.
